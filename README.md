# Python Best Practices

This repository is a selection of best practices we follow when working on Python projects. 


## Repository Structure

This repository is structured so that each topic (e.g. dependency management) has its own folder. Each folder contains a README.md and src folder with examples.

## Creating New Topics

The master branch is protected. When creating a new topic, create a branch and when ready a pull request. The same goes for making changes to topics.
